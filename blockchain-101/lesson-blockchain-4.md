# What’s a Hash?

The hash is important to understand here. What is commonly referred to as a hash is actually the output of a hashing function also known as the digest. The hashing function takes an input and then scrambles it to an output that is hard to decode. Let’s take the sentence “Meet me in New York City at 11PM by TimeSquare”.Once we run that through our hashing function it’s output will look like this “B21Z97X11…”. 

This functionality allows a level of anonymity on the blockchain since your name won’t be revealed in the ledger but rather a hash of your wallet that stores your crypto currency and NFTs.
