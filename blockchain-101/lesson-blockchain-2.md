# Problems the Blockchain Aims to Solve

How can we guarantee that you own this apple? How can we guarantee the quality of apples that you have? And more importantly, how can we guarantee that you didn’t copy and paste the image of the Apples 10 times to claim you have 10 apples (known as the double spending problem)? Who will audit the transactions of the apple to verify these claims? How can we ensure that your friend won’t go back in time and edit your transaction to claim you sent them a 100 apples instead of one?

These are some of the core issues that the blockchain aims to solve.
