# Welcome ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the start of your journey to become a blockchain developer. The things you can build on the blockchain are endless. You can create your own NFTs, Tokens, and even your own metaverse. For this course we will be focused on the Ethereum blockchain. We arenâ€™t going to go into too much nitty gritty details since our goal is to give you a high level overview of what it is like developing in this emerging ecosystem. 

For all the hype around NFTâ€™s, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies it may seem like it is ethereal but once you get the hang of it, you will see it might be even simpler than web or mobile development.

We are so excited to see what you build ðŸ› 

### Why the blockchain?

We need to provide some additional context, before we provide a definition of the blockchain to understand the why behind the blockchain. If you were selling an apple to a friend in the real world for a dollar. Your friend would receive that apple and you would have one less apple or zero apples and your friend will have one apple. 

Now letâ€™s pretend you took a picture of that Apple and promised your friend that the JPEG photo of the Apple represents the real apple you own and if they send you a dollar over PayPal you will give them the Apple.
